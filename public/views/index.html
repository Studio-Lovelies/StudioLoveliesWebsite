        <h1 class="center">Welcome to Studio Lovelies!</h1>
        <h2>How's it going?</h2>
        <h3>We're fine! Thanks for asking!</h3>
        <p>So, yeah... Just wanted to welcome you to our website, feel free to look around :) There might be some hidden stuff!<br />No, there isn't... But it couldn't hurt to look for them! Just in case...<br /><br />Anyways, I am Isaac, one of the lead programmers in the wonderful Studio Lovelies team. I made this cause, hum... the game is finished. Well at least I hope so, I'm still waiting on people to test out the latest changes so we don't lose face in front of the Grumps. Speaking of, "Game Grumps: Joint Justice" is the first of (probably) many projects to come from us, and we're very excited to show it to the world! We have a team composed of really talented artists, writers, composers, programmers and fantastic team leaders. We've all worked really hard on this since September of 2019. Well, I think so, I wasn't there for half of the project, I joined in August of 2020. And now <b>boom</b> here we are with a game that we hope you and the Grumps will love!</b><br />Well, looks like it's all the time I have! Don't forget to click on the "Contact" tab if you want to ask, complain, insult or just to stay in touch! I'll see you out there, I got to go and do se-<br />Stuff. Just, <b>stuff</b>.<br /><br />- Isaac</p>

        <h2>Game Grumps: Joint Justice</h2>
        <h3>The game</h3>
        <p>Production is officially finished! We sent an e-mail to the Grumps team and we got in touch with their Social Media manager, Allie.<br />Last updates we got from her says they're currently playtesting it, so the ball is in their court!</p>
        <h3>Platform change</h3>
        <p>We used the LÃ–VE (love2d) engine to make this game, and unfortunately, this engine runs Lua, which is not the most powerful language.<br />On a better note, big chad Jape Falcon started converting the game into the Unity engine, so get ready for some better graphics, run-time, load times and new game mechanics!</p>
